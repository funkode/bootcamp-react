Exercise 18.

1. Implement the delete operation on the table using a the Mutation component.

2. If your number is even then use refetchQueries to refresh the daya.

3. If your number is odd then use direct cache read/write and optimisticResponse to perform the deletion.

Hint: Queries and Mutations can be nested inside of each other.

4. Ensure it works. Good luck!
