Exercise 11

1. Create a new component named Car Edit Row.

2. Car Edit Row should display a row where you can edit each field. Ensure the fields are populated with that row's widget.

3. The row's last column should have two buttons: Save and Cancel. DO NOT IMPLEMENT SAVE AND CANCEL IN THIS EXERCISE, BUT DISPLAY THE BUTTONS.

4. Add an Edit button to the Car View Row component.

5. When the Edit button is clicked, the Car View Row for that row should be changed to the Car Edit Row.

Note: Only one row is editable at a time. If you click Edit on another row, currently editable row, becomes a Car View Row, and the row clicked on becomes editable. If the Delete button or the Add Car button is clicked all rows are view only.
